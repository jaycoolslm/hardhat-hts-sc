# Hedera Smart Contract Basics: Deploying Smart Contracts with Hardhat and Ethers

Welcome to another episode of Hashgraph Hub's Hedera Smart Contract Basics. In this episode, we're going to guide you through deploying smart contracts using Hardhat and Ethers.

This guide is divided into six steps:

## 1. Initialise Hardhat

We'll start by setting up a new Hardhat project. Use the command `npx hardhat` to start a new project and follow the prompts.

## 2. Install NPM Modules

We'll then install the necessary npm modules for our project. Use `npm install` along with the name of the modules needed for this project.

## 3. Set Up Wallets

Before we can interact with a contract, we need a wallet. We'll walk you through setting up an Hedera wallet and connecting it to the Hardhat network.

## 4. Write Script

Next, we'll write a script that deploys our contract. This script will import our wallet and contract, connect to the network, and then deploy the contract.

## 5. Run Test

We'll then run the script using Hardhat's task runner. By running `npx hardhat test`, Hardhat will execute our script and deploy our contract to the network.

## 6. Check Hashscan

Finally, after deployment, we will verify the contract's existence on the network using Hashscan.
